This documentation accompanies TEAD, an Taylor expansion-based adaptive design algorithm for efficient global surrogate model construction. The TEAD algorithm is proposed in a manuscript entitled "A Taylor expansion-based adaptive design strategy for global surrogate modeling with applications in groundwater modeling" by Mo SX, Lu D, Shi XQ, Zhang GN, Ye M, Wu JF, and Wu JC, submitting to Water Resources Research. The surrogate method containing in this documentation is Radial Basis Function (RBF) implemented in MATSuMoTo toolbox developed by Dr. M¨¹ller (M¨¹ller J., (2014). MATSuMoTo Code Documentation.). It is noted that the RBF used in our manuscript mentioned above is the multi-quadric RBF implemented in the SUMO toolbox (Gorissen, D., Couckuyt, I., Demeester, P., Dhaene, T., & Crombecq, K. (2010). A surrogate modeling and adaptive sampling toolbox for computer based design. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 11(Jul), 2051-2055.), which is available at http://www.sumo.intec.ugent.be/SUMO.

Four examples are provided in the documentation, one can easily test a new example by refering the four examples. To run TEAD, run the m-file runTEAD.m.
